# Configuring Nginx

If you followed the previous steps correctly, you should now have your own instance of Enotify up and running with a discord bot and website.

By default, the website runs on port `8000` but can otherwise be configured in the `.env` file. It can be served directly (with the correctly configuring DNS), or optionally you can configure **Nginx** as a reverse proxy in order to serve the website on port `80` and/or `443`.

In this example we will be using `example.com` as our hostname for Enotify's website, make sure to replace this with the hostname that you will be using.

    ## Installation

    1\. Install **Nginx**.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    ```

    <br />

    2\. Remove the default Nginx page.

    ```bash
    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```

    <br />

    3\. Create a custom Nginx config.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example
    ```
    ```conf title='/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example'
    server {
        server_name example.com;  # replace with your own hostname

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;  # change port if you have configured it otherwise
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
    ```

    <br />

    4\. Reload Nginx.

    ```bash
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```

:::note
Make sure that you have port forwarded ports `80` and/or `443` if applicable.
