# Starting Enotify

Before building your Enotify instance, verify that you have configured all the environment variables within the `.env` file.

Navigate into the local repository's base directory, and run the following:


```bash title="Build Enotify"
docker compose build
```

```bash title="Start Enotify"
docker compose up -d
```
